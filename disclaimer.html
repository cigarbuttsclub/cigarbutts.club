      <p>
        Welcome to a stock trading club that delivers you <strong>weekly picks of curated momentum stocks</strong>,
        and <strong>directs proceeds to charity</strong>. This way you get stocks with high-probability of
        appreciation in the short-term, whilst giving back to worthy causes - it's a win-win!
      </p>

      <p>
        Here's how it works - every Saturday Cigarbutts Club generates a list of momentum stocks that we
        think are poised to move within the coming week or so (naturally <em>there is no guarantee of this</em>
        - see our <a href="./disclaimer.html" target="_blank">disclaimer</a> for more information). You can
        purchase access to a randomised selection of 3 stocks from the list, or access to the full list.
      </p>

      <p>
        You won't find anything important here. Mostly, a catalogue of my thoughts on certain subjects
        in the form of essays and blog posts - I find that the process of writing helps to clarify, and
        structure my thinking. I'll also list the programs I develop with links to
        <a href="https://github.com/jmsmistral" target="_blank">Github</a>.
